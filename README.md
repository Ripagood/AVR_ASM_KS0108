# AVR_ASM_KS0108
Controller and demo for a 128*64 GLCD based on the KS0108 controller, written in pure ASM.

For a quick showcase, see it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3iNPR1YJbI)

This library was done for an Atmega16 running on the internal 8MHz oscillator.

Also included is a Proteus ISIS simulation. You can check the connections for the 
DATA and CONTROL ports there or directly in the asm source.
